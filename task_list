* setup state machine for capturing data from ms5611
* setup for capturing data from ibus receiver (UART)
* setup for capturing + parsing gps data and setup the board (UART)

* use 1 UART for debugging through bluetooth
* add a battery to debug remotely

* set up atleast 6-8 motor pwn pins controllers
* test thier working with standard servos

* get PCB printed OR solidify loose wires
* PCB must have 3 + additional mounting holes

* store raw accl/gyro/magn data
* make pitch and roll angle estimation using accl and gyro
* make yaw x-axis direction estimation using magn (component-int out in global x-y plane) and gyro

* compute velocity in local directions by integration
* compute corresponding velocities in global axis
* use accl + ms5611 (for z axis velocity) + gps (for lat-long plane velocity)

* get altitude raw from ms5611 + accl (for correct throttle control)
